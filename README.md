**A. Codes needed to replicate the part "POEC and tensions on the broader labour market":**

1. The R scripts transitions_poec.R and transitions_control.R allow to replicate the sub-part "POEC and transitions on the labor market, a descriptive analysis"
2. The R scripts macro_strat_normalize_precis.R (pre-processing) and IV_estimate_precis.R allow to replicate the sub-part "Causal effect of POEC on the tension on the labor market at the region- occupation level".
3. The R script etab.R allow to get the graphics presented in the Appendix (part "POEC and tensions on the broader labour market"). This script also searches for and constructs a relevant instrumental variable.

**B. Codes needed to replicate the part "Job duration after a POE training":**

1. The SAS script Creation_base_etude.sas allows to generate all the preprocessing steps. This code creates the database used for implementing the *mixed matching* methodology.
2. The R script allows to implement the *mixed matching* methodology.
